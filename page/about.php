        I may not doing well in what I am doing right now
        but my motivation is beyond the chart. It's not
        everyday though. Some days I felt sad for no reason.
        Some other days I felt overwhelmed of everything.
        Then there are days that even the end of the world
        can stop me.

        For some people, programming is one of their most
        depressing and tiring thing they have to deal with but
        for me programming is the only thing that keeps me happy
        Our code may fail us but our code never succeed to stop us
