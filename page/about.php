<h4 class='sub'>Why I love programming?</h4>
<h5>
    Programming is one of the few things that I
    enjoy in my life. When I code, I feel powerful
    because I can make something out of nothing.
    Imagine yourself writing a few line of code
    and suddenly it becomes a working calculator
    on your pc. I know the feelings because I
    did that a few weeks after I get my first laptop.

    For some people, programming is one of their most
    depressing and tiring thing they have to deal with but
    for me programming is the only thing that keeps me happy
    Our code may fail us but our code never succeed to stop us
